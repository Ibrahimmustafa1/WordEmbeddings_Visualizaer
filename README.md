# Word Similarity Graph

This project visualizes the similarity between words based on their word embeddings. The word embeddings are 2-dimensional, as defined in `embedding.py`.

## Features

- Input a word and get a graph of similar words.
- The distance between words in the graph reflects their similarity.
- Each word is assigned a unique color for easy identification.
